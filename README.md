Limitations
This is a frontend-only implementation using localStorage:

User data is not persisted across browsers/devices

Passwords are stored in plain text (not secure for production)

For a production environment, you would need to:

Implement a proper backend server

Use database storage

Implement password hashing

Add proper authentication security

Future Enhancements
Backend integration with:

User authentication API

Database storage for QR codes

Sharing functionality

Additional features:

QR code scanning capability

Batch QR code generation

Analytics tracking for QR code scans

Custom frame/styling options
